# libwally-core
Useful primitives for wallets.

Please report bugs and submit patches to https://github.com/jgriffiths/libwally-core.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jgriffiths/libwally-core.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jgriffiths/libwally-core)

## Building

```
$ ./tools/autogen.sh
$ ./configure <options>
$ make
$ make check
```

### configure options

- `--enable-debug`. Enables debugging information and disables compiler
   optimisations (default: no).
- `--enable-coverage`. Enables code coverage. See tools/coverage.sh for
   instructions on generating a coverage report (default: no). Note that
   you will need [lcov](http://ltp.sourceforge.net/coverage/lcov.php)
   installed to build with this option enabled and generate coverage reports.
- `--enable-export-all`. Export all functions from the wally shared library.
   Ordinarily only API functions are exported. (default: no).
- `--enable-swig-python`. Enable the SWIG python interface. The resulting
   shared library can be directly imported from Python. (default: no).
- `--enable-swig-java`. Enable the SWIG java (JNI) interface. After building,
   see `src/swig_java/src/com/blockstream/libwally/Wally.java` for the Java
   interface definition (default: no).

NOTE: If you wish to run the tests you currently need to pass
      the `--enable-swig-python` option. This requirement may be removed
      in a future release.

## Cleaning

```
$ ./tools/cleanup.sh
```

## Submitting patches

Please use pull requests on github to submit. Before producing your patch you
should format your changes using [uncrustify](https://github.com/uncrustify/uncrustify.git)
version 0.60 or later. The script `./tools/uncrustify` will reformat all C
sources in the library as needed, with the currently chosen uncrustify options.

You should also make sure the existing tests pass and if possible write tests
covering any new functionality added, following the existing style.

## Recommended development dependencies

- [lcov](http://ltp.sourceforge.net/coverage/lcov.php)
- [uncrustify](https://github.com/uncrustify/uncrustify.git)

  v0.60 (unfortunately debian/ubuntu brings v0.59 by default)

  The version of uncrustify in Debian is unfortunately out of date and buggy. If
  you are using Debian this means you will need to download and build uncrustify
  from source using something like:

```
$ git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/uncrustify/uncrustify.git
$ cd uncrustify
$ ./autogen.sh
$ ./configure
$ make
$ sudo make install
```

### Recommended development configure
```
$ ./configure --enable-debug --enable-export-all --enable-swig-python --enable-coverage
